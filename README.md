ABC Gaming Platform Loyalty Score Optimization
This repository contains the analysis and proposal for a new loyalty scoring system for the ABC Gaming Platform. The previous model was flawed, primarily rewarding users for large deposits rather than for genuine, sustained engagement.

The Problem
The original loyalty system was heavily skewed towards financial transactions. Key issues included:

Over-reliance on Deposits: Users could earn a high loyalty score with a single large deposit, even if they were inactive afterward.

No Penalty for Inactivity: The system failed to account for user recency, allowing dormant users to remain at the top of the leaderboards.

Ignoring True Engagement: Players who consistently engaged with the platform by playing many games were not adequately rewarded, leading to an unfair system.

Vulnerability to Abuse: The old formula could be "gamed" by users who made large deposits and then quickly withdrew the funds, earning points without contributing to platform health.

The Solution
A new, behavior-based loyalty scoring model was designed to address these issues. The revised formula incorporates a more balanced set of metrics to reward genuine loyalty:

Recency: A multiplier that penalizes users for inactivity, ensuring leaderboards reflect current engagement.

Net Deposit: A small component that accounts for the difference between deposits and withdrawals, discouraging quick fund cycling.

Stickiness & Frequency Bonus: Rewards for users who retain their funds on the platform and who make regular, consistent deposits rather than one-off large sums.

Game Points: A significantly increased weight for the number of games played, directly rewarding active gameplay.

Results and Impact
The implementation of the new formula yielded a fairer and more accurate representation of platform loyalty.

Rank Rebalancing: Many high-depositing, low-engagement users saw their ranks drop, while consistent players with modest deposits moved up.

Improved Metrics: The new system places a stronger emphasis on metrics that support long-term business growth, such as user retention and active engagement.

More Accurate Leaderboards: The leaderboards now accurately showcase the most active and engaged members of the community, supporting a healthier ecosystem.

By shifting the focus from simple financial transactions to a more holistic view of user behavior, the new loyalty system better aligns with the platform's goals of fostering a loyal and active user base.
